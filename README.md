# Backbone Example Web App TodoMVC

This [sample app](http://backbonejs.org/examples/todos/) is based on Backbone Example from [official website](http://backbonejs.org/).

> Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
